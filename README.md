## Python 3 ##

I started out writing for Python 3, 


## py-libsonic ##

git clone https://github.com/crustymonkey/py-sonic.git
# switch to API 1.8.0 branch of the library
git checkout api_1.8

# copy connection.py, errors.py, __init__.py to:
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libsonic
# take care to look what exact Python 2.x dir to use; it has to reflect the Python version you use (major and minor version in python --version)

python mellow.py


## Basic tutorial ##


## TODO ##

# Cache file(s) before play
# Use GStreamer for playing the files
# MPRIS2 support for remote connection (sound menu, keyboard hotkeys)
